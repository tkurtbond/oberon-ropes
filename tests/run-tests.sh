# Run the fixtures in this directory against the example programs and
# report how many passed.  With -v, also announce each test and its
# outcome as it goes.  With -o, do that and also show what each program
# actually printed (everything it wrote, exactly as it wrote it, and its
# exit status), whether the test passed or not.  Any other arguments name
# the tests to run, instead of all of them; each may be a bare NAME,
# NAME.test, or tests/NAME.test.
# The programs are run from BINDIR, relative to the directory above
# (default: that directory itself), so a build made elsewhere, like poc's
# in poc-build, can be tested too.

#
# A fixture is tests/NAME.test, with these lines, in this order:
#
#   program NAME     the example program to run, in the directory above
#   arg VALUE        one command line argument; repeat for each argument
#                    (a bare "arg" is an empty argument)
#   env NAME=VALUE   set an environment variable for the program; repeat
#                    for each variable (optional)
#   dir DIRECTORY    run the program in this directory (optional)
#   input FILE       the program's standard input, relative to DIRECTORY
#                    (optional; default /dev/null, so no test can hang
#                    waiting on the terminal)
#   status N         the expected exit status
#   output           everything after this line is the expected output
#
# Lines starting with # before "output" are comments.  Trailing white
# space is ignored when comparing output, and so are the "Terminated by
# Halt(N)." lines that voc's runtime prints after a HALT (poc's does not).
# Programs are run by their full path, which they may print as their name,
# so that is replaced by the bare NAME in what they print.  Both the
# output and the error output are compared, mixed together.
